# Logging-Python
Logging-Python is a Python project that demonstrates the usage of the logging module for effective logging in Python applications. It showcases two different approaches to logging, namely the "Clean Code" approach and the "Old Code" approach.

## Introduction
Logging is an essential aspect of any software application as it helps developers understand and debug the behavior of their code. The logging module in Python provides a powerful and flexible logging framework that allows developers to log messages with various levels of severity, customize log formatting, and redirect log output to different handlers (e.g., console, file, etc.).

This project aims to highlight the importance of writing clean and maintainable logging code by comparing the "Clean Code" approach, which follows best practices and recommended patterns, with the "Old Code" approach, which showcases outdated and less organized logging practices.

## Features
- Two logging code examples: Clean Code and Old Code.
- Demonstration of best practices for logging in Python.
- Comparison of clean and maintainable logging code with outdated practices.

## Prerequisites
Before running the examples in this project, make sure you have the following installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)

## Usage
To run the examples, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/eYasarbas/Logging-Python.git
```
- Change to the project directory:
``` bash
cd Logging-Python
```
- Execute the clean code example:
``` bash
python new_code_example.py
```
- Execute the old code example:
``` bash
python old_code_example.py
```
Both examples will demonstrate logging messages with different severity levels, custom formatting, and log output to both the console and a log file.
